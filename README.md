# OddPerfectRoots
It is possible and surprisingly easy to compute the kth root of a value n such that n = a^k, a being an integer from 0 to 100.
This is mainly due to our number system and attainable as an impressive party trick with little brain cpu demands.
I have made this simple game to practice my own perfect odd roots which I use primarily entertain and at times teach mathematics.
